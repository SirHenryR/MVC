Media Validation for Cellebrite JSON
Check for missing python packages using -p.

Check help using -h.

## Purpose of script

The script renames the files that have been exported using PA to their original filename, if a file with the name exists, a increasing number is added to the file name.
In addition the files are checked whether they are a valid media file (image/video). If not, the file is deleted.

The script is meant to reduce the exported files to those that are working.
